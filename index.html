		<p class="blue-text">I was born in England and spent my childhood in a small town called Letchworth Garden City. This is located in North Hertfordshire, just north of London.</p>

		<section><h2>Vermont, USA</h2>
		<p>In 2014, I had the opportunity to work for a summer at a non-profit organisation called Farm & Wilderness located in Vermont, USA. I really enjoyed working there that I returned the summer of 2017. Martha was also working here in 2017, and after the summer we began our long distance relationship.</p>

		<section><h2 class="blue-text">Saint Louis, MO</h2>
		<p>In 2019, after being approved for a fiance visa - I officially moved to the US. We decided to move to Saint Louis as this was where Martha was from originally. In 2020, we bought our first home together in Tower Grove South.</p>
